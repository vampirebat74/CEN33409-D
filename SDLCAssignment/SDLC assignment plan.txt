The program will start by directly reading the provided HTML file into a buffered reader.
By separating the buffer through arrays, only the sections under <p> class "center", "ph2" and "poem" will be read, ignoring the HTML code.

The text inside the BufferedReader will then be sorted by word, of which the means will be calculated
and sorted in order of top 20.
